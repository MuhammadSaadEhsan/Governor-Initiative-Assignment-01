// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

var transport = ["bike","car","bus","cycle"];
console.log(`i like to go to university with my ${transport[0]}\nI want to drive your ${transport[1]}\nI usually travels through ${transport[2]}\nI love my ${transport[3]}`);
