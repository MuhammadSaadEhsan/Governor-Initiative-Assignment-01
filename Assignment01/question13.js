// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
var transport = ["bike", "car", "bus", "cycle"];
console.log("i like to go to university with my ".concat(transport[0], "\nI want to drive your ").concat(transport[1], "\nI usually travels through ").concat(transport[2], "\nI love my ").concat(transport[3]));
